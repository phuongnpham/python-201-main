# Trip Cost Calculator

This is a small project to get yourself warmed up and keep training your newly found skills in collecting user input and formatting strings.

Create a Python script that asks a user questions in the command line. The script should follow the outlined specifications.

### Specifications

Receive the following arguments from the user:

- Kilometers to drive
- Liters-per-kilometer usage of the car 
- Price per liter of fuel

Calculate the cost of the trip and display it to the user in the console. Apply some of the string formatting tricks that you learned about in this course section.
